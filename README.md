## DigiTue Ground Truth

This repository contains transcriptions for digitized books and journals of
the University Library of TÃ¼bingen (http://idb.ub.uni-tuebingen.de/digitue/).

The transcriptions were done with eScriptorium, a transcription platform
developed as part of the Scripta and RESILIENCE projects
(https://gitlab.com/scripta/escriptorium/).
