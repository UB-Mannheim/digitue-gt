## DigiTue Ground Truth

This directory contains transcriptions for some books which were digitized
by the University Library of TÃ¼bingen in the DigiTue collection
(http://idb.ub.uni-tuebingen.de/digitue/tue/).

The transcriptions were done with eScriptorium, a transcription platform
developed as part of the Scripta and RESILIENCE projects
(https://gitlab.com/scripta/escriptorium/).
