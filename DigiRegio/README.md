## DigiRegio Ground Truth

This directory contains transcriptions for some books which were digitized
by the University Library of Tübingen in the
[DigiRegio collection](https://opendigi.ub.uni-tuebingen.de/digitue/regio).

The transcriptions were done with
[eScriptorium](https://gitlab.com/scripta/escriptorium/),
a transcription platform developed as part of the Scripta and RESILIENCE projects.
